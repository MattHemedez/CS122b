Our search query contained multiple like statements and used widely through our searching interface. Firstly the movie title contained a like statement where all string matches a pattern given by the user input. For example if a user entered the query “The”, our search interface would contain a query that looks like %The%. The results of the browsing would contain a pattern with “The” anywhere, it could match the beginning of a movie title that has “The” or inside the movie title like “OTHER” and followed by the rest of the title. The way our director search and star search worked was by using the same mechanism described above. To illustrate, if a user inputed “Jon” in a star search or a director search the names that would pop up would be any string that contains the words “jon” or the string can be found within the name such as “Jonathan.”
