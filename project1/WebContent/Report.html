    <td>This computation ran with 10 thread (users) and used connection pooling. Again this computation even with 10 threads showed little to no difference from the 
		above averages. This is probably due to the fact that the queries were cached in connection pooling in this example and each call from the thread just used the 
		cache results/query. Thus realistically even with 10 threads it is actually running like it suppose to with 1 thread.</td>

    <td>21.11</td>
    <td>For this computation we used 10 threads (users) and no prepared statements. This time the average search servlet time significantly increased because the usage of 
		prepared statements happens in two steps, which is slower then the normal query statements. However, the average JDBC times went up significantly for this case 
		as well. The query is not cached this time so there is no reuse of the duplicate queries (movie titles) in our search.</td>

    <td>2.53</td>
    <td>This computation consisted of 10 threads (users) and no connection pooling. At a quick glance we see that there are big increases on the average query time and 
		average serach servlet time. This is because it does not reuse the connection pooling, and opens a new connection every query. Where as in the old compuations there	
		is connection pooling reusing the connections.</td>

    <td>This test ran with 10 threads without using prepared statements. This test shows a remarkable difference as the average Search Servlet time increased substantially to just under 10 seconds which is extremely large relative to the previous tests. Their was no significant increase in the average jdbc time which probably indicates that the code became significantly less efficient when not using prepared statements. This was unexpected as instead the average jdbc time should been the most significant difference due to  prepared statements not being cached and prepared(in the database) before hand.</td>

    <td>2.006</td>
    <td>This test ran with 10 threads without using connection pooling. Looking at this there was no significant difference between this case and case 2 of the scaled versions. This is odd, as there should be an expected increase in the average Search Servlet time at least as the lack of connection pooling meant that there should be an increase in overhead maintaining and creating connections to the database for each individual user.</td>
