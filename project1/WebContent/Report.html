	<td>This computation consisted of 1 thread (user) and using Connection pooling. The average times of this case came out as expected, where the average search time
		came out as 187ms and the JDBC time as 2.12ms. The average query time came out to be 352, which was similar to the other connection pooling schemes.</td>

    <td>2.26</td>
    <td>This computation ran with 10 thread (users) and used connection pooling. Again this computation even with 10 threads showed little to no difference from the 
		above averages. This is probably due to the fact that the queries were cached in connection pooling in this example and each call from the thread just used the 
		cache results/query. Thus realistically even with 10 threads it is actually running like it suppose to with 1 thread.</td>

    <td>55.73</td>
    <td>21.11</td>
    <td>For this computation we used 10 threads (users) and no prepared statements. This time the average search servlet time significantly increased because the usage of 
		prepared statements happens in two steps, which is slower then the normal query statements. However, the average JDBC times went up significantly for this case 
		as well. The query is not cached this time so there is no reuse of the duplicate queries (movie titles) in our search.</td>

    <td>268.67</td>
    <td>2.53</td>
    <td>This computation consisted of 10 threads (users) and no connection pooling. At a quick glance we see that there are big increases on the average query time and 
		average serach servlet time. This is because it does not reuse the connection pooling, and opens a new connection every query. Where as in the old compuations there	
		is connection pooling reusing the connections.</td>
